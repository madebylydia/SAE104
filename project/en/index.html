        <h1>Fabricius : The giant project of a little life</h1>
        <h2>Intro-duck-tion</h2>
        <p>
          During my high school years, I discovered the communication platform
          called <b>Discord</b>, surely an useful app, where everyone can create
          their very own profiles, chat with others, join a community, and do
          great things!
        </p>
        <p>
          Inside these communities, it isn't rare to see they are helped by
          bots. Automated account that do actions for you, like managing
          members, sending fun message, creating events, it's... rich!
        </p>
        <p>
          One of these community I've joined myself is
          <b>Red-DiscordBot</b> (Simply called as "Red"), a community with one
          goal : Create a robust open-source bot that everyone can extend with a
          system of modules (Called Cogs). Each person that host their own
          instance of Red can extend it to their own liking, with what they want
          in their bot. The only limit being the person that host his Red, or
          Discord.
        </p>
        <p>
          As such, a great community of developers started gathering around Red,
          and create many awesome modules for Red, from the smallest to the most
          ambitious ones. If you ever dreamed to catch Pokemons on Discord, you
          can do that with you own Red bot!
        </p>
        <p>
          However, when a developer has a brand new idea for a module, he would
          finds himself having to redo the first manipulations, creating 3
          files, which consists of this base:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>A <samp>__init__.py</samp> with a setup function.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              A <samp>info.json</samp> with information about the module and its
              author.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              A file (with whatever name you like, doesn't matter) that defines
              what the module do, but follows a few rules (create a class, give
              basic information, a command, etc.).
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          So I, who also wanted to develop my modules, didn't particularly like
          creating this base manually every time: I wanted to automate this
          task, and so <b>the Fabricius project began!</b> A project template
          rendering tool !
        </p>
        <h2>'scuse me? Project templating?</h2>
        <p>
          A project templating engine boils down to a simple thing: Create from
          the basis of a project, a brand new, working project from information
          supplied by the user.
        </p>
        <p>
          Basically, you create a layout, retrieve information, populate with
          user's information, and create a new project! All that's left is to do
          what you want with your working project!
        </p>
        <h6><i>What about existing tools?</i></h6>
        <p>
          Red was coded in Python, so developers were used to Python tools such
          as black, isort, mypy, etc. It was logical to create a Python tool.
        </p>
        <p>
          Regarding templating engines renderer, it boils down to two tools:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><p>CookieCutter</p></li>
          <li><p>Copier</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          CookieCutter is definitively the most popular, with its 20,000 stars
          on GitHub, however, there's a few problem with this one:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><p>It's poorly maintained.</p></li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Doesn't allow for validation/modification of user's input (which,
              yes, can be extremely useful).
            </p>
          </li>
          <li><p>It's not customizable.</p></li>
          <li><p>It crashes a lot and doesn't feel trustable enough.</p></li>
          <li>
            <p>It forces you to follow a certain pattern for your layout.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Even if I tried this tool, I couldn't use it because... Well it just
          doesn't work at all!
        </p>
        <p>
          and then comes Copier, however, that one looks incredible by itself:
          It's maintained, feels robust, and is dang customizable!
        </p>
        <p>
          The reason why I didn't use this tool instead, is because I wanted to
          test myself and create a new challenge: I wanted a new tool, one that
          was like CookieCutter, but even better, a universal tool that would
          even render CookieCutter projects!
        </p>
        <p>
          But why, you might ask? Because everyone, who once used CookieCutter,
          might not want to change for a new tool, they would prefer using the
          same they use because they've already been using it! HOWEVER, if
          you've provide the same fonctionnalites with a better tool, there is a
          much better chance you interest peoples!
        </p>
        <p>
          I also wanted to take inspiration from the
          <a
            href="https://docs.adonisjs.com/guides/ace-commandline#templates-generator"
            >AdonisJS's template generator</a
          >, which, to me, looked just awesome and showed my vision for
          Fabricius! I wasn't just creating a simple tool, but an extendable
          tool! The Jack of all trade!
        </p>
        <p>
          For the development of Fabricius, I decided to put myself a few
          constraints to respect, but also complex, for the better:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><p>To be a 100% working and tested tool.</p></li>
          <li><p>Extendable with plugins.</p></li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Must respect user's security (Unallow malicious scripts or
              unauthorized execution).
            </p>
          </li>
          <li><p>Must be fully typed.</p></li>
          <li>
            <p>Must be future-proof: Easy to add code, modify it, etc.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Respect a folder structure that makes it clear what you're coding.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Technical information</h2>
        <p>
          Fabricius started in July 2022, at this point, the last minor version
          of Python was the <samp>3.10</samp>, but a few months later, the
          <samp>3.11</samp> version would come up, adding a few nice things I
          was interested into, and most importantly, new typing tools for the
          langage's typing system.
        </p>
        <p>
          As of today, Fabricius is being worked on with the
          <samp>3.12.0</samp> Python version, a version that introduce a new
          syntax for generic classes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fabricius is still a work in progress, most of the time is put into
          how the project should look like, how it must feel like, what's its
          philosophy, what I should respect, etc..
        </p>
        <p>
          It's really important to think about this as soon as possible, as
          Fabicius is meant to evolve in the future, and it includes a ton of
          things in one single package:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Create a resistant CLI tool that won't let you down (Made with
              <samp>click</samp> and <samp>rich</samp> and assisted by
              <samp>aspreno</samp> and <samp>clickloader</samp>).
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Create classes to represent objects : Files to create, projet to
              build, etc.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Render template with the user's given information (Made with
              <samp>jinja</samp>, <samp>chevron</samp>,
              <samp>str.format</samp> and <samp>string.Template</samp>).
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Allow a plugin system (Based on the concept of
              <a href="https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/observer"
                >observers/listeners</a
              >).
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Reimplement project rendering of templates made with
              <samp>cookiecutter</samp>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Be able to register user's settings in a persistent file (Made
              with <samp>platformdirs</samp> and <samp>pydantic</samp>).
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          To make all of this in one package, that's a LOT of work! Most
          especially when you try to respect a structure that itself, hold a
          certain philosophy.
        </p>
        <h2>My resources</h2>
        <p>
          …but as always, in development, we're never alone ! With such big
          project, I have the luck to have learned about useful resources and
          awesome peoples that would help me out:
        </p>
        <h3>Refactoring Guru</h3>
        <p>
          This website is just AWESOME, to anyone who wants to learn how to
          refactor their code, on how a program can behave, be structured or be
          created. Be sure to find this website very helpful whenever you try to
          create a new project and would like to make things as clean as
          possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thanks to this website, I was able to understand and learn about new
          patterns in programmation, on top of the one I was already using
          myself, but blindly.

        <h3>Fluent Python, by Luciano Ramalho</h3>
        <p>
          Luciano Ramalho is a member of the PSF (Python Software Foundation),
          so he's definitively one of the best person to tell you about the most
          specific stuff in Python, and that's what his book does. Fluent Python
          is the resource that helped me understand the design behind Python and
          how to take full advantages of its potential, like magic functions!
        </p>
        <h3>Red-DiscordBot</h3>
        <p>
          The community I owe everything.<br />Thanks to this community, drived
          by friends from all over the world, they helped me and pushed me to
          program, and be who I am today, but also who I want to be for the
          foreseeable future. Red has so many wonderful peoples, so awesome that
          they helped me achieve things I thought I would never be able to
          tackle down myself.
